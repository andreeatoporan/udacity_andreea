			<p class="description">Goitered gazelles get their name from the large bump on their throats. The bump is larger on males. It is a large patch of cartilage that helps them bellow loudly to potential mates during mating season. Gazelles can stand on their back legs to reach leaves high in the branches of trees.</p>
