Hello Udacity,

I am so proud to be part of this program.
First of all, i've learned to understand what is behind every html page (lot of work and imagination). Also, i've learned to be able to write (translate) a html page with links, images and text.I can't wait for learning more :)

What has been easy?
Well, it hasn't been to easy but it helped a lot the videos from the beginning and the good structure of the pages content. I understood very well everything. I wish to find in the next lessons more videos.

What has been difficult?
It hasn't been too difficult yet. 

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I've tried to learn as much i could from every lesson and from Slack and i've tried to apply my knowledges to the projects.

Kind regards,
Andreea Toporans
